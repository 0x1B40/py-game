# RL Space Adventure

 a Pygame-based, space-themed game integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Q-learning and interactive gameplay. Players control a spaceship on a grid to collect stars 
while avoiding asteroids and managing fuel. 


The game offers two modes: Manual Mode (arrow keys) and RL Mode (agent-controlled). 
the RL agent learns optimal actions using a discretized state space (player position, fuel, nearest star/asteroid distances) and a Q-table. 

main libraries: pygame and numpy.
